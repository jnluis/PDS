# Aula05 - Notes

To run each one of the programs, compile the whole folder, correspondent to each exercise.
  - To compile: javac ./lab05/ExY/*.java (where Y is the number of the exercise)
  
  - To execute: java ./lab05/ExY/ExY_Main (where Y is the number of the exercise)

Note: You probably have to update package(s) in different files before trying to compile the program.
